# Movie-reccomendation

In this project I built a baseline Movie Recommendation System using TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset.

There are three filters used here:


Demographic Filtering- They offer generalized recommendations to every user, based on movie popularity and/or genre
        
Content Based Filtering- They suggest similar items based on a particular item. This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations
        
Collaborative Filtering- This system matches persons with similar interests and provides recommendations based on this matching. Collaborative filters do not require item metadata like its content-based counterparts.
